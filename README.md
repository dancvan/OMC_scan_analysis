# OMC_scan_analysis
Contains software designed to analyze OMC scans

In my experience OMC scan tools have been made by various individuals. The work that goes into these scripts can be very time consuming, especially if one has never analyzed these scans before. 
My goal for this project is to try and make analyzing OMC scans an acessible to young comissioners so they don't need to spend much time making these scripts and can focus on doing more science / improving the detector.
